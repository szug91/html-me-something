	<p><strong>“Only when we are brave enough to explore 
                    the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.”

	<p> Dr. Brown is a research professor at the University of Houston 
            Graduate College of Social Work and has become well know for her research on vulnerability, 
            courage, worthiness, and shame. </p>

	<p>When things look bleak or when you feel like it’s easier to hide than to come into the light, 
	   allow these quotes on guilt, shame and vulnerability to inspire you! </p>

	<ul>

		<li>Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running 
			from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving 
			up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only 
			when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power 
			of our light.</li>

		<li>Shame, blame, disrespect, betrayal, and the withholding of affection damage the roots from 
			which love grows. Love can only survive these injuries if they are acknowledged, healed
			 and rare</li>

		<li>If we can share our story with someone who responds with empathy and understanding, shame 
			can’t survive. </li>

		<li>Guilt is just as powerful, but its influence is positive, while shame’s is destructive. 
			Shame erodes our courage and fuels disengagement</li>

		<li> If you trade your authenticity for safety, you may experience the following: anxiety, 
			depression, eating disorders, addiction, rage, blame, resentment, and inexplicable 
			grief.</li>
	</ul>
